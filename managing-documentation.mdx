## Structuring Your Content

Organize your Relevize documentation into a clear hierarchy to improve navigation and user experience. Start by creating top-level topics, then add subpages and nested content.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Top-Level Topics" icon="folder">
    Navigate to your workspace dashboard. Click **New Topic** and enter a title like "API Reference".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Subpages">
    Inside a topic, select **New Page**. Use the frontmatter to set titles and descriptions:
    
````mdx
```yaml
---
title: Authentication
description: Manage user sessions and API keys.
---
```
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Content">
    Drag and drop pages to create nested structures. Limit depth to three levels for optimal readability.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming conventions, such as "Verb + Noun" (e.g., "Install SDK", "Configure Settings").
